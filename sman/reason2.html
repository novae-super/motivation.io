                Again, people under appreciate you, for everything you do for them. You always try your best to make everyone happy, and you stand up for others when they cant.<br>
                Even just saying that you have a good vibe isn't enough, because you're more than a good vibe. For starters you are an amazing dancer!<br>
                No seriously, you are amazing at dancing. The clips I have seen of you dancing are absolutley amazing! I could never do stuff like that lmao<br>
                You are also a really good cat parent, from what I've seen. You take amazing care of you're cats, and I bet each and every day they are really grateful that you are in their life<br>
                Also your imaginination is amazing, I wish I could have an imaginination as good as yours :)
