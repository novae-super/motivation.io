            <h2 class="headers">What this website is</h2>
            <p>
                I created this website, because I noticed that you were feeling more,<br>
                well, not good, so I'm hoping that this website at least boosts your mood a bit.

            <h2 class="headers">Why am I doing this?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm doing this because I care about you, and it pains me to hear that your being driven insane,<br>
                and not getting the respect you deserve. It's unjust, and not fair at all.<br>
            </p>

        <div class="explain3">
            <h2 class="headers">Any other reason I am doing this?</h2>
            <p>
                The other reason I am doing this, is that I don't feel Preston is enough for you.<br>
                I feel like if this relationship was going better for you, you would probably be a lot happier.<br>
                Also he is a lacrosse player, nothing good ever comes from lacrosse players :)
