            <p>
                I don't think you have been treated fairly at all, by anyone, by me, and I wanna apologize, because you don't deserve that, at all<br>
                If I could go back in time, I would tell myself, that this girl, sammy, is probably going to be one of the most important people in your life, don't harm her<br>
                I regret all of the terrible decisions I made back then, but even with all the bad, we had a ton of good times as well, and I cherish those and look back on them each day<br>
                I miss us, and I have tons of regrets that I can't undo, and I'm so sorry for all the pain I caused you. I guess in the future we shouldn't threaten anyone with a good time ;)<br>
                In all seriousness, I think I have made my decision. I have a bit more thinking to do, but I think I have made it. So let's just say, if I do confirm my current feelings, emotions, and everything else<br>
                Let's just say, that with your permission, I would be able to take you to the fields and stargaze with whatever snacks we bring :)
