                I don't think you understand how much you mean to me. It will be two years since we have met, but it's felt like such a short time.<br>
                Also, I never thought your presence could get any better, I had a lot of my best laughs with you, but oh my god.<br>
                In person it is just such a better experience! You are such an amazingly fun person to be around, and I feel people take that for granted.<br>
                You are an amazing human being sammy, and no where near enough people appreciate you for the energy you bring to anyone.<br>
                I know our past is very complicated, but every time I see you I feel a spark of joy, and I just know I'm going to have a good time whenever you're around :)
